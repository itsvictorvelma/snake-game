# Snake Game 🐍

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.x-blue)](https://www.python.org/) 

A classic Snake game built in Python using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Turtle Graphics**.  
This is my first real project using classes to structure the game logic for a clean and maintainable design.

---

## Features

- Move the snake with arrow keys (`↑ ↓ ← →`)
- Eat food to grow the snake
- Score tracking
- Game over on wall collision or self-collision
- Simple, clean visuals built with **Turtle Graphics**
- Fully OOP structured code for maintainability

---

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/itsvictorvelma/snake-game>
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
```bash
cd snake-game
```

3. Run the game

```bash
python main.py

```
or 
```bash
python3 main.py
```
4. Use the arrow keys to control the snake and try to eat as much food as possible without hitting the walls or yourself.\

## Built With ##

- Python 3.x

- Turtle Graphics

- Object-Oriented Programming (Snake, Food, Score classes)
